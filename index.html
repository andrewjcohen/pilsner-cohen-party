			<h4>Alison Marie Pilsner</h4>
			<p>A native of Illinois, but an East Coast girl at heart, Alison spent the majority of her childhood in Harrisburg, PA. She grew up getting muddy on the soccer field, wearing a pink tutu on the stage, and spending weekends exploring with her family. Alison attended the University of Pittsburgh for both undergraduate and graduate school where she earned Psychology/Spanish and Master of Public Health degrees. While at Pitt, she played Division-I soccer, studying in Spain, and met her lifelong friends and bridesmaids.</p>
			<p>After spending 6 wonderful years in the 'burgh, Alison headed to Washington, DC to pursue a research fellowship at the National Cancer Institute. The next 4 years were filled with new experiences, new friends, and the opportunity to travel and work around the world. In 2012, Alison followed her heart to Boulder, CO to start the next chapter of her life. Today, she works as a digital health strategist, is preparing to go back to school, and loves spending time on her yoga mat and exploring all that the Rockies have to offer!</p>
			<h4>Andrew Jason Cohen</h4>
			<p>Always the Southern gentleman, Andrew was born and raised in Richmond, VA. He grew up scrapping his knees skateboarding, riding BMX bikes, and playing soccer. Andrew attended George Mason University in Fairfax, VA where he obtained a BA in Graphic Design and spent most of college racing downhill mountain bikes along the East Coast.</p>
			<p>Post-college Andrew stayed in the DC area working as an Interactive Designer, playing soccer at night, and mountain biking on the weekends. However, he always knew his heart belonged out west where the mountains were bigger. In 2011 after running his own independent design studio for a few years, he relocated to Boulder, CO and immersed himself in the startup scene. Today he works in Denver, CO at <a href="http://thoughtbot.com">thoughtbot, inc. <i class="icon-external-link"></i></a>, loves bicycles, motorcycles, Arsenal FC, and hanging out with Alison and their dog in the great outdoors.

			<h4>How We Met</h4>
			<p>Placed on the same co-ed soccer team in Washington, DC three years ago, Alison and Andrew quickly developed a special friendship on and off the field. When Andrew tore his ACL (the first time) Alison was there to help get him off the field. Not only did she bake him plenty of cookies, she provided laughs while Andrew hobbled around for months. As the months went on, Andrew knew there was something about his friend he couldn't shake. Four days before moving to Colorado, Andrew decided it was a good idea to bring Alison home to meet his parents, and ask her to date him long distance.</p>
			<p>Distance couldn't keep them apart for long, because Andrew tore his ACL again and needed Alison by his side. After spending a week nursing him back to health Alison decided at the beginning of 2012 to pack her bags and move to Colorado to be with Andrew, essentially sight unseen!</p>
		</article>
		<article>
			<h4>Our Engagement</h4>
			<p>On January 18, 2013, Andrew popped the question under the Colorado sunset of Evergreen Lake! Alison had been begging Andrew to go ice skating with her for months, so she thought this was just another fun date night in the mountains. Not knowing what Andrew had in store, Alison hopped in the car after yoga class and believed all of the tricks. Wanting to take the perfect panoramic photo of the frozen lake, Alison walked herself right over to "the spot" Andrew was hoping to propose.</p>
			<p>Thinking he was not cooperating for her photo, Alison's kodak moment turned into Andrew down on one knee. Excited and eager to try on the bling, Alison almost forgot to say "YES!" Sneaky Andrew even managed to propose where there was no cell phone reception so that they could enjoy a beautiful (and uninterrupted!) dinner at Willow Creek Restaurant overlooking Evergreen Lake. They arrived home to Alison's first wine club shipment on the front porch and celebrated as friends dropped off special surprises!</p>

				<h5>Attire</h5>
				<p>The ceremony will be held outside on the grounds of Della Terra, which sits within Rocky Mountain National Park. Come prepared for any weather that Colorado may throw our way. May in the Rockies could mean 80 degrees and sunshine, or snow. The reception will be held indoors and outdoors, and the venue will supply umbrellas in the event of a light afternoon shower. Keep in mind that the elevation of Estes Park, CO is at 7,500 feet, so it gets chilly when the sun goes down. It's not a black tie affair, but please try to stick to semi-formal/cocktail attire. </p>

				<p>We will be providing free shuttle transportation from Estes Park hotels to Della Terra. More details to come on shuttle times and locations.
